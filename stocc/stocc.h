 *
 * Description:
 * This file contains function prototypes and class declarations for the C++
 * library of non-uniform random number generators. Most functions are fast and
 * accurate, even for extreme values of the parameters.
 *
 *
 * functions without classes:
 * ==========================
 *
 * void EndOfProgram(void);
 * System-specific exit code. You may modify this to make it fit your
 * user interface.
 *
 * void FatalError(const char * ErrorText);
 * Used for outputting error messages from the other functions and classes.
 * You may have to modify this function to make it fit your user interface.
 *
 * double Erf (double x);
 * Calculates the error function, which is the integral of the normal distribution.
 *
 * double LnFac(int32_t n);
 * Calculates the natural logarithm of the factorial of n.
 *
 *
 * class StochasticLib1:
 * ====================
 * This class can be derived from any of the uniform random number generators
 * defined in randomc.h. StochasticLib1 provides the following non-uniform random
 * variate generators:
 *
 * int Bernoulli(double p);
 * Bernoulli distribution. Gives 0 or 1 with probability 1-p and p.
 *
 * double Normal(double m, double s);
 * Normal distribution with mean m and standard deviation s.
 *
 * double NormalTrunc(double m, double s, double limit);
 * Truncated normal distribution with tails cut off at m +/- limit
 *
 * int32_t Poisson (double L);
 * Poisson distribution with mean L.
 *
 * int32_t Binomial (int32_t n, double p);
 * Binomial distribution. n trials with probability p.
 *
 * int32_t Hypergeometric (int32_t n, int32_t m, int32_t N);
 * Hypergeometric distribution. Taking n items out N, m of which are colored.
 *
 * void Multinomial (int32_t * destination, double * source, int32_t n, int colors);
 * void Multinomial (int32_t * destination, int32_t * source, int32_t n, int colors);
 * Multivariate binomial distribution.
 *
 * void MultiHypergeometric (int32_t * destination, int32_t * source, int32_t n, int colors);
 * Multivariate hypergeometric distribution.
 *
 * void Shuffle(int * list, int min, int n);
 * Shuffle a list of integers.
 *
 *
 * class StochasticLib2:
 * =====================
 * This class is derived from class StochasticLib1. It redefines the functions
 * Poisson, Binomial and HyperGeometric.
 * In StochasticLib1, these functions are optimized for being called with
 * parameters that vary. In StochasticLib2, the same functions are optimized
 * for being called repeatedly with the same parameters. If your parameters
 * seldom vary, then StochasticLib2 is faster. The two classes use different
 * calculation methods, both of which are accurate.
 *
 *
 * class StochasticLib3:
 * =====================
 * This class can be derived from either StochasticLib1 or StochasticLib2,
 * whichever is preferred. It contains functions for generating variates with
 * the univariate and multivariate Wallenius' and Fisher's noncentral
 * hypergeometric distributions.
 *
 * int32_t WalleniusNCHyp (int32_t n, int32_t m, int32_t N, double odds);
 * Sampling from Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution, which is
 * what you get when taking n items out N, m of which are colored, without
 * replacement, with bias.
 *
 * int32_t FishersNCHyp (int32_t n, int32_t m, int32_t N, double odds);
 * Sampling from Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution which is the
 * conditional distribution of independent binomial variates given their sum n.
 *
 * void MultiWalleniusNCHyp (int32_t * destination, int32_t * source, double * weights, int32_t n, int colors);
 * Sampling from multivariate Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.
 *
 * void MultiFishersNCHyp (int32_t * destination, int32_t * source, double * weights, int32_t n, int colors);
 * Sampling from multivariate Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution.
 *
 *
 * Uniform random number generators (integer and float) are also available, as
 * these are inherited from the random number generator class that is the base
 * class of StochasticLib1.
 *
 *
 * class CWalleniusNCHypergeometric
 * ================================
 * This class implements various methods for calculating the probability
 * function and the mean and variance of the univariate Wallenius' noncentral
 * hypergeometric distribution. It is used by StochasticLib3 and can also be
 * used independently.
 *
 *
 * class CMultiWalleniusNCHypergeometric
 * =====================================
 * This class implements various methods for calculating the probability func-
 * tion and the mean of the multivariate Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric
 * distribution. It is used by StochasticLib3 and can also be used independently.
 *
 *
 * class CMultiWalleniusNCHypergeometricMoments
 * ============================================
 * This class calculates the exact mean and variance of the multivariate
 * Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric probability distribution.
 *
 *
 * class CFishersNCHypergeometric
 * ==============================
 * This class calculates the probability function and the mean and variance
 * of Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution.
 *
